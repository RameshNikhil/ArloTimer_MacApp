# TinyTimer_MacApp

### What? 
MacOS doesn't have a native clock app with a stopwatch and timer so I build one. 

### Stack 
Everything runs locally, built with flutter 

### Build time 
Striated but somewhere around 4 hours, shamefully a lot of which was time spent deciding on a pleasing colour pallet and font

### Whats not working? 
The timer. Clone it, have a crack at fixing it and prettying it up then hmu with a pull!

### How can you run it? 
-- unfortunately flutter for MacOS is not deployable rn so you can check out the web version @ **http://loose-baloon.surge.sh/#/**
