# TinyTimer_MacApp

### What is it? 
MacOS doesn't have a native clock app with a stopwatch and timer so I build one. 

### Stack?
Flutter for the build, hosted with the Surge CDN

### Build time 
Striated but somewhere around 4 hours, shamefully a lot of which was time spent deciding on a pleasing colour pallet and font

### Whats not working? 
The timer. Clone it, have a crack at fixing it and prettying it up then hmu with a pull!

### How can you run it? 
-- unfortunately flutter for MacOS is not deployable rn so you can check out the web version:
-- also idk why its buggy on the webapp - ill have to fix this in the future 

_> To fix, navigate the the last page by clicking and dragging, or clicking the arrows then navigate back
